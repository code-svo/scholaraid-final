## 📌 Problem Statement


Problem Statement 1-Weave AI magic with Groq

Problem Statement 4-Craft the Future of Onchain Consumer experience with Base



## 🎯 Objective

Our project is a real-time educational scholarship portal where applicants are onboarded and funds are distributed via base and applicants are evaluated via groq.

## 🧠 Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
RoastedCode

### Team Members:  
- Shubhajit Sarkar ([Github](https://github.com/code-svo) / [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/withshubhajit)/ Team Leader- UI/UX Designer,Frontend Dev)
- Souvik Roy  ([GitHub](https://github.com/Souvik313) / [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/souvik-roy-a8ab04337) / Team member)

### Your Approach:  
- Because as college freshers ourselves, we can understand the problems due to the financial barriers faced by lower and lower middle-class youth of India
- Connecting to the onchainkit of base, creating smart contracts using base sepolia metwork, creating all the frameworks using next.js and using styling approach
- Blockchain is a new domain for us. We started with small project like crowdfunding campaigns, simpler smart contracts, learning the bits and essentials, gathering basic understanding. Henceforth creating ScholarAid as the final project after many hours of researching and coding. It was not possible to build this project alone and we learned how to work better as a team. We learned how to connect smart wallets with the help of web3 technology.

## 🏁 Final Words

hackathon journey —The late-night coding session for the HackHazard 25, organized by the Namespace community, was an unforgettable rush of energy, creativity, and pure determination. As midnight crept in, the room buzzed with the relentless tapping of keyboards and the low murmur of teammates brainstorming breakthroughs. Under the soft glow of monitors and the haze of caffeine-fueled focus, time lost its meaning.

Even as fatigue set in, the spirit of innovation kept us alive — every bug we crushed and every feature we deployed was a testament to the passion that united us. The environment wasn’t just about coding; it was a celebration of teamwork, perseverance, and the thrill of turning bold ideas into reality.

Through the long hours, driven by the vibrant spirit of the Namespace community, HackHazard 25 became more than just a hackathon — it became a memory of pushing boundaries, chasing dreams, and creating something extraordinary in the dead of night.
